# Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

An analysis of a data set with a report detailing my findings.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to determine an effective demographic group to target for coupon marketing.
### Assumptions
We must assume that coupon marketing has a cost associated with it, otherwise this project has no point. 

A lower budget is better, so long as it generates a relatively higher return. A return in this case would be a customer using the coupon, denoted as "Y" in the data source.

## Findings

### Section One: Bar Coupons
In the first section, we investigate bar coupons. Our research involves discovering the most effective use for our couponing budget, by optimising which groups we market these coupons to. Our findings are as follows:

1. The most likely people to accept a coupon and use it are those who regularly go to the bar anyways. Those who visited the bar more than 4 times monthly were the greatest proportion of coupon acceptants.
2. Those under the age of 30 were also more likely to visit bars.
3. Those without children in their vehicles were also more likely to visit bars when recieving coupons.
4. To a lesser extent, widows and the separated also seemed more likely to visit bars.

### Section Two: Coffeehouse Coupons

In the second section, we perform an independent investigation on coffee shop coupons. Our findings are follows:

1. People who lived between 5 and 15 minutes from the coffee shop were more likely to accept the coupons.
2. People were more likely to accept and use the coupons on days where the weather was around 80 degrees farenheit and sunny.
3. People were much more likely to accept the coupons around 10AM, and still more likely than average around 2PM.
4. People under the age of 26 were more likely than average to accept the coupons.

## Next Steps

The ideal next steps based on this report would be to:

1. Calculate the cost per successful coupon delivery for previous marketing attempts.
2. Use the now generated formula to develop a plan to deliver targeted coupons.
3. Use this plan to deliver the optimal ratio of coupon/marketing cost to revenue. 

The point of these next steps would be to spend the least amount on marketing coupons to generate the most number of customers. This again relies on the assumption that sending the coupons to customers has some sort of cost associated with it. In the case that the coupons are free, the best possible thing to do is to send it to every single person available, focusing on simply the largest groups of people who accepted and used the coupons.
