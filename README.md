# Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

An analysis of a data set with a report detailing my findings.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to determine an effective demographic group to target for coupon marketing.
### Assumptions
We must assume that coupon marketing has a cost associated with it, otherwise this project has no point. 

A lower budget is better, so long as it generates a relatively higher return. A return in this case would be a customer using the coupon, denoted as "Y" in the data source.
